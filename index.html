                  <h2>International Olympiad of Informatics</h2>
                  Problem solving at its highest levels, the International Olympiad of informatics puts the greatest young minds against one another to solve problems using code and I was there to see it all. <br> <br>

                  While students from all around the world had come to compete with their coaches, guides had a task of helping them out with what they needed from translating to throwing birthday, parties we were there to help. Meeting people from around the world and some one the brightest young mind from each country was just how it sounds amazing and daunting at the same time. The contestants came with an open mind ready to expect the unexpected. I can only assume what they were told before coming to Iran and well you could see it, they were as curious as can be.

                <h2>Challenging Europe</h2>
                <p>
                  During two weeks, we engaged with European Londoners, who have come from other parts of Europe to make London their home.
                  They were then subjects of the documentary film and portrait photography.
                  There we tried to understand how we can think of and, understand Europe through its cultural, religious and linguistic heritage.
                  <br>
                  Being apart of the <b>Sammi</b> team we tried to find Sammi Londoners and learn more about their history and culture as well as learning the basics of their language and its structure. Our experience and findings are shown in our winning video which you can have a loook at below.
